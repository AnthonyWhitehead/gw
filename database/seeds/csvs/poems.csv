1,anthonys-dogs,family,<p>Dogs bark, boys shout, </br>Anthony and his pets are about; </br>Running, racing, wild with joy, </br>Out on the rec. with their favourite boy. </br>Squirrel Nutkin, high in a tree </br>Says â€œBark if you like, youâ€™ll not catch meâ€ </br>Owl blinks his eyes in the noonday light </br>â€œDo let me sleep, Iâ€™ve been up all night.â€ </br>Gypsey, Abby, and Honey the bitch </br>Chasing rats in the farmyard ditch, </br>Four country companions, wild and free, </br>Theyâ€™ll be home at four for a country tea, </br>Bread and jam doorsteps and cake at its best, </br>And a bone for the dogs as they take their rest. </br></p>
2,a-tribute-to-joanny,family,<p>In linen dress of blue and white </br>She walked among the barley, </br>Her golden hair a ring of light </br>I loved her very dearly, </br>And on the way she laughed and talked </br>Of matters gay and homely, </br>Oh never a summer morning walked </br>A girl more pure and comely. </br></p><p> </br>Late, late returning, hand in hand </br>We scented suburbs wended </br>Where giant elms, and chestnuts grand </br>Their quiet boughs extended </br>We paused and kissed beneath the boughs </br>In places less well lighted </br>And with sincere and steadfast vows </br>Our tender troth we plighted. </br></p><p> </br>Our great grandchild stands on the lawn </br>And makes a chain of daisies, </br>And round her head this April morn </br>Great grandmaâ€™s halo blazes. </br></p><p> </br>Though more than 60 years have passed </br>Yet still I love her dearly </br>And see yet as once she walked </br>All smiling through the barely. </br></p>
3,glove-puppets,children,<p>Lonely the glove puppets lie in a drawer </br>Forlorn and forgotten, forsaken for more </br>Attractive possessions that thrive in the sun, </br>The ball, and the bat, and the rope and the gun. </br></p><p> </br>In the dreariest winter the glove puppet cheers </br>And the children respond with their laughter and tears </br>As that rascally ruffian Punch rushes in </br>Squeaky voice, heavy stick, and his nose to his chin. </br></p><p> </br>Between Punch and the clown quips and witty jokes fly </br>And he tosses the babe from the window so high </br>â€œOh where is my baby?â€ cries Judy in fear </br>And the villain replies â€œI've not seen her up here.â€ </br></p><p> </br>Then Aladdin appears with his lamp wondrous rare </br>Or Dick Whittington rises to be the Lord Mayor </br>Puss in Boots makes a marquis of his miller's boy, </br>Each off 'ring a spectacle children enjoy. </br></p><p> </br>But when Christmas is over in drawers they are laid </br>In the dark, where the dresses bright colours won't fade, </br>With camphor and moth balls to keep them from harm </br>Just imagine their claustrophobic alarm! </br></p><p> </br>So if youâ€™ve got a draw full of puppets so gay </br>Get them down on the beaches on a bright sum day </br>Put the stage p to windward, shout out nice and loud, </br>And give a grand show to the holiday crowd. </br></p><p> </br>The puppets just love to appear on the stage </br>Get them out of their mothballs and free from their cage, </br>Go and brighten the beaches, I'm sure you can do so </br>With a play about pirates, or Friday and Crusoe. </br></p>
4,holiday-journey,travel,<p>Sitting in the station, </br>Waiting for the train, </br>To take us to the seaside, </br>Itâ€™s summer once again, </br>Porters carrying cases, </br>For places far and near, </br>Kiosks selling magazines, </br>And bars for tea and beer. </br></p><p> </br>Sitting in the carriages </br>While diesel engines whine, </br>Listening for the whistle which </br>Will start us up the line, </br>Will whisk them to the West. </br></p><p> </br>Flying through the countryside, </br>Seventy miles an hour </br>Past many country villages, </br>And many a ruined tower, </br>Moling through dark tunnel ways, </br>Then dazzled by the radiance, </br>Of summer sun on cumulous, </br>While climbing up the gradients. </br></p><p> </br>Chattering, cheerful children, </br>Now the summerâ€™s here </br>Lessons done, and play begun, </br>In salty water clear, </br>Continental crossing gates, </br>Closing as we run, </br>To reach the West, where bathingâ€™s best, </br>Hurrying to the sun. </br></p>
5,in-memoriam-jack-titshall,war,<p>â€œJack Titshalls turn â€, said Sergeant Brown </br>â€œTo take the air testâ€, fetch him Geoff. </br>But when I told him he must fly </br>Jack Titshall turned as pale as death. </br></p><p> </br>â€œWhat ails thee lad?, said Sergeant Brown </br>The ground tests fine, youâ€™ll be all right.â€ </br>â€œIt breaks my dream, thatâ€™s all, said Jack. </br>My mother called me in the nightâ€. </br></p><p> </br>She said sheâ€™s see me soon, quite soon </br>And not to fear sheâ€™d stretch her hand </br>To free me from the burning plane </br>And take me to the Promised Land. </br></p><p> </br>â€œPilot to base, air test completeâ€ </br>â€œThen back you comeâ€, the tower called. </br>But as he lowered flaps and wheels </br>The stresses rose, the aircraft stalled. </br></p><p> </br>We watched the fire engines race </br>Towards that wall of fire and flame </br>And Sergeant Brown said â€œSteady lads </br>Letâ€™s hope to God his mother cameâ€. </br></p>
6,patricia,family,<p>A child that is born on Christmas Day </br>Is bound to be blithe and kind and gay, </br>Sheâ€™s bound to be clever and sweet and pure, </br>And neat and dainty and even demure, </br>But who could have guessed sheâ€™s be wild and free </br>With the wind in her hair as she ran oâ€™er the lea, </br>Athletic and graceful, a newly-born fawn </br>Who was up with the lark at the crack of dawn, </br>And who could have known as the family grew </br>That sheâ€™d mother the others and help them all through, </br>With a cuddle for one, and a kiss for the next, </br>And â€œDonâ€™t take things so hardâ€ for the one who felt vexed; </br>And Christmas was always a wonderful day </br>â€˜Til a smart chap called Derek just whisked her away. </br></p><p> </br>And what happened then, why this Christmas day child </br>Toured all-round the world, whether peaceful or wild, </br>With a small trail behind her, the kids of her man, </br>Our Simon, and Michael and Caroline Ann, </br>Bahrain, South Korea, Australia, Guam, </br>Manilla and Kenya and Dar-es-Salaam, </br>And New York, and Westport and Dallas-Fort worth </br>An occasional trip to the land of her birth, </br>And finally safe, in the land of the free </br>So that Carrie can start off a family tree. </br>A wonderful mother, a wonderful wife, </br>Courageous and organised all of her life, </br>So letâ€™s raise our glasses and drink a wee toast </br>To the wife, mother, daughter we all love the most. </br></p>
7,pharaohs-egypt,travel,<p>I stood upon the pyramid, </br>Where I had climbed so hot and slow, </br>And saw my giant shadow stretched, </br>Across the delta far below, </br></p><p> </br>Half in the shadow, half exposed, </br>Guarding the ancient catacomb, </br>The dog-like Sphinx forever waits, </br>Lest pharaoh whistle from his tomb. </br></p><p> </br>Below the deltaâ€™s arms embrace, </br>Great fan-shaped flakes of fertile farms, </br>Of maize and millet, rye and corn, </br>And myriad, mirrored, shimmering palms. </br></p><p> </br>Itâ€™s ancient, giant labours done, </br>Egypt, twin land of south and north, </br>Flexes her muscles in her sleep, </br>Till some new pharaoh calls her forth. </br></p>
8,penelope,family,<p>Pennyâ€™s a girl who enjoys a good walk, </br>Across Buntingford Common, all powdery chalk, </br>With a dog on a leash, and a hammer in hand, </br>To crack open the flints that we find on the land. </br></p><p> </br>While searching for fossils the country we roam, </br>Her mother is comfortably resting at home, </br>In her green and gold dress, very snoozy and snory, </br>With a gloss magazine, or a mystery story. </br></p><p> </br>Did anyone have a more wonderful pair, </br>With their freckly faces, and gingery hair, </br>And their giggly ways, and their quick repartee, </br>And their fondness for sweets, and their fondness for me. </br></p><p> </br></p><p> </br></p>
9,poplar-seasons,nature,<p>Across the valley in the snow </br>Two lines of Lombardy poplars go, </br>Like giant witches besoms brown </br>Stepping stiffly towards the town. </br></p><p> </br>Soon the warm spring winds will blow, </br>And melt the last of winterâ€™s snow, </br>The poplarsâ€™ buds will open out, </br>And pale yellow leaves will sprout. </br> </br>Pallid yellow turns to green </br>And fluttering wildly theyâ€™ll be seen, </br>Excited lines of green-gowned dancers, </br>Honouring partners for the Lancers. </br> </br>Summerâ€™s warmth and summerâ€™s haze </br>Still the leaves on summer days, </br>Two cool, delightful, shady files, </br>Stretched across two country miles. </br></p><p> </br>When the autumn leaves turn brown, </br>Octoberâ€™s gales soon fetch them down </br>And home-bound country footsteps press </br>Their crunchy, deep, deciduousness. </br></p><p> </br>Bare and brown, the trees once more </br>Cross the valley as of yore </br>Witches broomsticks long and lean </br>Waiting now for Halloween. </br></p>
10,space-adventure,travel,<p>Columbus sailed for Ferdinand </br>And found the Spanish Main; </br>Sir Francis Drake sailed round the World </br>And safely home again; </br>Mungo Park was first in Africa </br>The river Nigerâ€™s route to trace; </br>But the Russian Y.Gagarin </br>First went round the world in space. </br></p><p> </br>Da Gama went to India </br>By way of Table Bay; </br>Marco Polo travelled twenty years </br>To visit far Cathay; </br>Montgolfier the Frenchman </br>Was the first in a balloon; </br>But Anders, Lovell and Borman </br>First made rings around the moon. </br></p><p> </br>Walter Raleigh from Virginia </br>Brought us home tobacco Brown; </br>Pizarro from Peru sent back </br>Pure gold to Seville town; </br>Mendana from Brazil first proved </br>Elastic Rubberâ€™s worth; </br>But Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin </br>Brought the moon rocks back to Earth. </br></p><p> </br>Iâ€™d like to sail to China, </br>Or bring home the Burmese rice; </br>Iâ€™d like to tread Saharan sand, </br>Or Himalayan ice; </br>Or scan with mighty telescopes </br>The firmament for stars; </br>But most of all Iâ€™d like to be </br>The first to visit Mars! </br></p>
11,the-blind-veteran,war,<p>Speedwell blue upon the Downâ€™s </br>Buttercups and plantain crowns </br>And daisies pied upon the hill </br>I wonder if you bloom there still. </br></p><p> </br>In my youth I left the town </br>And wondered daily on the down </br>I took delight in Natureâ€™s store </br>Iâ€™ll never see her bounty more. </br></p><p> </br>Blind, I feel my way along </br>The paths I made, when I was young </br>And feel the springy turf I knew </br>When first I saw the speedwell Blue. </br></p><p> </br>In my darkness still I see </br>A giant red tailed bumble bee </br>With heavy body droning over </br>To sip the nectar from the clover. </br></p><p> </br>Natureâ€™s beauties round me press </br>Kaleidoscopic loveliness, </br>With these pictures in my mind </br>What matters if I am blind. </br></p>
12,a-place-at-the-table,war,<p>A cheerful man was Charlie Reeve </br>Tap-tapping at his cobblerâ€™s last </br>And whistling merry tunes he learned </br>In days long past. </br></p><p> </br>Five strapping sons had Charlie Reeve, </br>Called Charlie, and Leslie, Bob and Ron </br>And one whose name they never say </br>These ten years gone. </br></p><p> </br>One lovely girl had Charlie Reeve </br>With golden hair and dainty waist </br>A face to launch a thousand ships </br>In fevâ€™rish haste. </br></p><p> </br>Sit round the table dears </br>While mother fills each steaming plate </br>And then she may not see the place </br>That made us eight. </br></p><p> </br>And as you wrap my mended shoes </br>And show my mother to the door </br>I wish God could give back the one </br>Who went to War. </br></p>
13,caddis-fly-larvae,family,<p>Simon and Susan and Michael and Dan, </br>Went over the meadow with Caroline Ann, </br>And searched in the brook where the ripples unravel, </br>For caddis fly larvae with homes made of gravel. </br></p><p> </br>The caddis fly grub unprotected would be, </br>For a dragon â€“ fly larva a succulent tea, </br>So it builds round its body, to save it from harm, a </br>Sheltering case like a strong suit of armour. </br></p><p> </br>Their arms to the elbow in water immersed, </br>With long sweeping movements the stream is traversed, </br>And Simon and Daniel are first with a prize, </br>Two caddis fly grubs of diminutive size. </br></p><p> </br>Soon Suzie surprises by finding a case, </br>Made of pretty green snail shells, dainty as lace, </br>And Susie announces it must be a queen, </br>Dressed up for her wedding in emerald green. </br></p><p> </br>Then Michael and Caroline sit on the bank, </br>And study the grubs in the little glass tank, </br>And Caroline shouts as she wiggles her toes, </br>â€œSheâ€™s opened her doorway and popped out her nose.â€ </br></p><p> </br>Simon and Susan and Michael and Dan, </br>Came back from the meadow with Caroline Ann </br>With caddis fly larva, when evening is cool, </br>Resolved to present them to teacher at school. </br></p>
14,fortunes-in-the-tea-leaves,general,<p>Have a cup of tea my dear, </br>It comes from oâ€™er the sea, </br>From India, China or Ceylon </br>Where coolies gather tea; </br>Itâ€™s picked and withered, rolled and chopped, </br>And packed in lead-lined crates, </br>Transported, tasted, blended, brewed, </br>And used to tell our fates. </br></p><p> </br>To plant a great tea garden </br>You need a capital to pay, </br>To clear jungle, shade the seedling, </br>Prune course growth away; </br>For nimble-fingered Indian girls </br>To pluck the tender tips, </br>That five long years of husbandry, </br>Bring to your wifey lips. </br></p><p> </br>The world wide bonds of commerce </br>Spread prosperity to all, </br>Demand for tea in Basingstoke </br>Means wages in Bengal; </br>The Indian sub-continent </br>Prosperity achieves </br>When bids for tea in mincing lane </br>Means fortunes in the leaves. </br></p>
15,gavin-the-cat,general,<p>Ginger and white was Gavin the cat </br>As he lay by the fire stretched out on the mat, </br>And he closed his eyes, and his whiskers twitched, </br>And he dreamed his dreams, as his tail be switched. </br></p><p> </br>Gavin was dreaming of Bluebell Hill </br>And the juicy young rabbits he used to kill, </br>The mice from the rick, and the granary rats, </br>That nature provided as food for cats. </br></p><p> </br>But the city advanced, and the country fled, </br>And a concrete jungle grew up instead, </br>And a race of kittens was raised who thought, </br>That food was a substance the mistress bought. </br></p><p> </br>First it was liver, or bits of chop, </br>Or slices of cod from the fishmongerâ€™s shop </br>Now itâ€™s mashed up pilchards with vitamins </br>Or synthesized protein out of tins. </br></p><p> </br>Only Gavin remembers now, </br>The milk from Lucy the brindled cow, </br>Or waiting at dawn by riverside hole </br>For the taste of a juicy river bank vole. </br></p>
16,anthony-whitehead,family,<p>Anthony Whitehead has sent me a letter </br>It seems that his writing gets better and better </br>Heâ€™s drawn me a picture to show his ripped jeans </br>But Iâ€™m really not sure what this latter fact means </br>Did he tear them himself? Was it one of his dogs? </br>Or is he referring to very posh togs </br>With designer-made rips that are meant to have holes? </br>To keep Anthony cool when heâ€™s scoring his goals. </br>Heâ€™s smart, and heâ€™s clever, his hairâ€™s nicely curled </br>And thereâ€™s no better boy in the whole of the world! </br></p>
17,the-homesick-emigrant,general,<p>Graceful and dainty by the wall of the church </br>Silver and green grows a beautiful birch </br>Pendulous branches weeping for those </br>Asleep in the churchyard in regular rows. </br> </br>The riverâ€™s broad surface reflects back the scene, </br>An inverted image of azure green, </br>The church and the houses, the school and the mill </br>And fleecy clouds resting on Dunkery Hill. </br> </br>Delightful in spring time when new-born lambs play </br>All drowsy in summer amid the mown hay </br>All rosy in autumn when apples are right </br>And cheery at Christmas when windows shine bright. </br></p><p> </br>That photo reminds me of faraway home </br>Across mountain and desert and wild sea foam, </br>The great dusty outback recedes and grows small </br>And I stand â€˜neath the birch tree that weeps on the wall. </br></p>
18,the-origin-of-life,science,<p>If you want to go back to the â€˜Big Bangâ€™ </br>Thatâ€™s twelve thousand million long years, </br>While the dawning of life on our planet </br>Is four thousand mill. It appears, </br>We must look for our ancient ancestors </br>In the soup where the first microbes swam, </br>Which the dawning of life on our planet </br>Cooked up for our great, great grandma. </br></p><p> </br>We didnâ€™t develop from monkeys </br>Too simple that thought it appears, </br>Every microbe on earth had a part in our birth </br>Passing on useful skills down the years. </br>One skill was an art, respiration, </br>That helped these bacteria breathe, </br>And another gene may have transcribed DNA </br>A life-giving skill the bequeath. </br></p><p> </br>How long was this dawn-soup a cooking </br>A very long time it appears </br>The first era, called the â€˜The Archeanâ€™ </br>1.5 thousand long million long years, </br>The next, called the Proterozoic </br>Was 2000 million years more </br>And the rocks show the fossils of microbes </br>And lifeâ€™s chemical traces galore. </br></p><p> </br>Now consider the word â€˜generationâ€™ </br>For humans-say-twenty five years, </br>Thatâ€™s four generations a century </br>And 40 in one thousand years; </br>Only 0 since Rome, in its glory </br>Held much of the world in its power </br>But microbes are quicker than humans </br>They have three generations an hour!!! </br></p><p> </br>So imagine the billions of microbes </br>In Archean/Proterozoic times, </br>Our frenzied, frenetic ancestors </br>Multiplying away in the slimes, </br>These billions of new generations </br>With potential to make a new gene, </br>Some monsters, some freaks, some exotics, </br>Some sublime, some divine, some obscene. </br></p><p> </br>From the end of the Proterozoic </br>To the time that we live in today </br>Years five hundred and forty mill-i-on </br>We have all come a very long way </br>This timeâ€™s split into 62 ages </br>Where a new form of lifeâ€™s given birth </br>And the ages conclude with catastrophes crude </br>A meteorite hitting earth. </br></p><p> </br>So the long fossil chain down the ages </br>Reveals there was plenty of time </br>For Natureâ€™s haphazard selection </br>To produce human beings sublime </br>Weâ€™ve discovered our ancient ancestors </br>But what is surprisingly odd </br>That among all these archaea-bacteria </br>There is no sign at all of a God. </br></p><p> </br>It appears that the Gods have been wanting </br>The architects of the world we survey, </br>Didnâ€™t come here to seeâ€™ till 3000BC </br>When the priesthood of Amun held sway, </br>And they, and their later derivatives </br>Jehovah and Christ and the rest </br>Made spurious claims to have thought us all up </br>When in fact weâ€™d evolved with great best. </br></p><p> </br>Both Gods that we know just talk nonsense, </br>They lack ancestry, not enough years, </br>To know what we know of the great long ago </br>We are no longer wet round the ears. </br>And â€œHurrahâ€ for palaeontologists </br>Whose research and struggles and strife </br>Showed the Gods as pathetic imposters </br>And teased out the secrets of life. </br></p>
19,the-maidn-aunts,family,<p>Geoff was a boy with four maiden aunts </br>A quartet of relations acquired by chance, </br>Three of them teachers and one a nurse; </br>And doing them justice they could have been worse. </br> </br>Leading the group very old and wise </br>Aunt Maud was a teacher of ample size, </br>Good â€“humoured and witty whenever she came, </br>With a generous spirit to match her frame. </br></p><p> </br>Little Aunt Edie was second in line, </br>â€œGentle religiousâ€™ describes her fine, </br>Taught music to earn her precarious bread, </br>But sparing a morsel for Godâ€™s unfed. </br></p><p> </br>Jess was a nurse up in Mansfield Town, </br>So poorly paid that she rarely got down, </br>But cheerfully extrovert all her days, </br>With a Nottingham accent and Nottingham ways. </br></p><p> </br>More rarely visiting, rich Aunt Win </br>With an old Morris motor we all piled in </br>For a Christmas treat, or a day at the sea, </br>Or a trip to the zoo with a posh cream tea. </br></p><p> </br>Why didnâ€™t they marry these ladies four </br>You see they were young in the First World War </br>When the flower of England died to a man </br>In the bloodiest war since the world began. </br></p><p> </br>Find similar groups today you canâ€™t </br>For thereâ€™s nothing so rare as a maiden aunt </br>And boys today you could never detect </br>As rich as Geoffrey in this respect. </br></p><p> </br>Generous, gracious, affectionate, kind, </br>Strong in adversity, steadfast of mind, </br>Sober, industrious, naught can supplant </br>The fondness Geoff feels for maiden aunt. </br></p>
20,the-hills,general,<p>I hear the birds around me singing </br>On this fine and bright spring time morning, </br>And though my thoughts can trouble me so </br>Within natureâ€™s tranquillity my sorrows do go </br>To a distant place, a recess if you will, </br>Far over yonder, a distant hill. </br></p><p> </br>Of mountains and adventure I often dream </br>When Iâ€™m the antagonist of my darkest scene </br>For thereâ€™s nothing better than air beneath your feet </br>The feel of rock, and a climbing project to defeat; </br>To pull you back from the very brink </br>Of feeling that life, may become extinct. </br></p><p> </br>So into the van, I pack my things </br>And onwards to the hills by daydream I cling </br>Onto memories of movement and the exhilarating rush </br>Of the peaks I have conquered, a life force if you must; </br>That keeps me fit in both body and mind </br>Iâ€™ll be back to those hills, for they are life, defined. </br></p>
